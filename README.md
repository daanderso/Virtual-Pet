    Virtual Pet App
    ================
    
    Synopsis:
    ---------
    Meet Drago the Dragon. Drago is a virtual pet. You may feed him, play with him, give him water and he sometimes needs 
    rest. Once Drago's needs reach 50 he will start to need more attention. Drago has a mind of his own sometimes so he may 
    feed himself, drink, entertain himself, or take a nap. Lastly, be careful when any of Drago's needs get close to 100. 
    If you wait too long to address them he can tragically pass away. There is a lot displayed on the console after time
    advances so you may need to scroll up to see all the details.
